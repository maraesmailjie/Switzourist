        <p>Basel is a city in northwestern Switzerland on the river Rhine. Basel is Switzerland's third-most-populous city (after ZÃ¼rich and Geneva) The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local Basel German dialect.
Basel is commonly considered to be the cultural capital of Switzerland. Basel is famous for its many museums, ranging from the Kunstmuseum, the first collection of art accessible to the public in the world (1661) and the largest museum of art in Switzerland, to the Fondation Beyeler (located in Riehen) and the Museum of Contemporary Art (Basel), the first public museum of contemporary art in Europe. Forty museums are spread throughout the city-canton, making Basel one of the largest cultural centres in relation to its size and population in Europe.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The University of Basel, Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to humanism, have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Holbein family, Friedrich Nietzsche, and in the 20th century also Hermann Hesse and Karl Jaspers.
Basel was the seat of a Prince-Bishopric starting in the 11th century, and joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the Renaissance, and has emerged as a centre for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by Theodor Herzl as the location for the first World Zionist Congress, and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the Bank for International Settlements. The name of the city is internationally known through institutions like the Basel Accords, Art Basel and FC Basel.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Located right on the border with France and Germany, Basel has an amazing medieval old town centre for you to explore alongside lots of great museums, contemporary architecture and historical landmarks. In addition to this, it also makes for a fantastic base if you want to visit the Jura Mountains or the Black Forest in Germany and Alsace in France.
Running through the city is the wonderful Rhine river which peacefully meanders its way through the charming towns of Laufenburg and Rheinfelden in the east of the region as well as the beautiful medieval city of Aargau which is where the Hapsburgs originated from.
Dotting the picturesque countryside are some great castles for you to visit such as those at Wildegg and Lenzburg and lots of charming little villages for you to stop off at as you explore Northwestern Switzerland.</p>
