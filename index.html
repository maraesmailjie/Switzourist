        <p>Its a place where tourists can learn more about this beautiful haven, share pictures from their own journeys and give us new information and feedback.</p>
        <br/>

I will name the cities i have chosen in order of the picture links, i start of with Switzerland itself i then have Zurich, Geneva/Genf, Basel, St Gallen, on each page you will find a short description of the page, an image gallery is also included. The last picture is that of a form, I have added this feature to my website as well so you can give us feedback and i can hear from you. </p>
