        <p>It evolved from the hermitage of Saint Gall, founded in the 7th century. Today, it is a large urban agglomeration (with around 167,000 inhabitants in 2019) and represents the center of eastern Switzerland. Its economy consists mainly of the service sector. The city is home of the University of St. Gallen, one of the best business schools in Europe.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>The main tourist attraction is the Abbey of Saint Gall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Abbey's renowned library contains books from the 9th century. The official language of St. Gallen is (the Swiss variety of Standard) German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect. The city has good transport links to the rest of the country and to neighbouring Germany and Austria. It also functions as the gate to the Appenzellerland. As it stretches from Lake Constance in the north to the Alps in the south, Eastern Switzerland boasts a diverse array of landscapes and is a delight to visit whatever time of year you go.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In summer the alpine meadows are ideal for hiking or cycling in while in winter the scenery is just as spectacular and lends itself perfectly to skiing and snowboarding. Indeed, the views on show are nearly always heart wrenchingly beautiful to behold as scenic alpine villages are tucked away amidst the Appenzell Alps and valleys. In addition to its wealth of outdoor activities and natural sights, Eastern Switzerland is also home to Saint Gallen which boasts lots of fantastic old buildings, interesting museums and of course the famous Abbey of Saint Gall which has a wonderful library for you to visit.</p>
